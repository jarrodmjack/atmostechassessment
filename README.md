# Introduction

This is a technical assessment project for Atmos.

---

# Objectives

- Create a React layout where a user can select a home or lot and view compatible homes/lots via a modal.
- User can save houses/lots in state and saved houses/lots will persist between route change (not on refresh).
- Use redux to store information in a global store

# Optimizations 

  These are some of the optimizations I am in the midst of implementing into this project.
  
- Add some more CSS and polish.
- I am working on a branch that is storing the API data in a global store but having trouble integrating that into the rest of the app.
- Add query parameter change when selecting a home/lot.
